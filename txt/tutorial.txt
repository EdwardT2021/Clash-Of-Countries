Hello and welcome to Clash Of Countries! This is the tutorial!
This is the board you will be faced with upon entering every battle!
On the LEFT, you will see your two COUNTRY cards, and two BUFF cards
On the RIGHT is the same, but for the ENEMY
Up top, is a timer for the battle, and a turn counter, along with the ELO of the enemy and yourself
ELO is a rating given to you representing how SKILLED you are.
In each country card, are a few key statistics
TOWNS are used to represent the HEALTH of a country. When it hits 0, this card DIES
MIGHT represents your ATTACKING POWER, and DEFENSE represents your DEFENSIVE POWER 
SIEGE ATTACK represents your SIEGE ATTACK POWER - This will be covered shortly
SIEGE DEFENSE represents your SIEGE DEFENSE POWER - This will also be covered shortly
FORTIFICATIONS represents how well fortified your country is
There are a few units in the game that help decide your attack/defense statistics
INFANTRY, TANKS, PLANES, SIEGE DEFENSE, SIEGE ATTACK, and FORTIFICATIONS
These units are built via PRODUCTION POWER, displayed in the production menu
When you want to attack another country, you must first overcome its FORTIFICATIONS
This is done via pitting your SIEGE ATTACK POWER against it 
One fortification is destroyed by 40 siege attack power!
Before this enemy defensive artilley rains down upon you 
This destroys ONE ATTACK artillery for every THREE DEFENSE artillery 
Once this stage has been completed, any REMAINING fortifications take away 200 ATTACK POWER
After this, your REMAINING ATTACK POWER is pitted against the enemies DEFENSE POWER
If you manage to win, for every 25 attack power you have left, ONE TOWN is destroyed
Upon a loss, heavy casualties are taken, with only 65% of your troops left!
Upon a victory, a much more manageable 85% of your troops remain!
There are three types of country - Aggressive, Balanced, Defensive
AGGRESSIVE countries are represented by RED
BALANCED countries are represented by PURPLE
DEFENSIVE countries are represented by BLUE
An example of each country except defensive is shown on the board 
Who knows, one could await you at the end of this battle!
There are many different types of BUFF, affecting all statistics
There are FORTIFICATION buffs, that add a number of fortifications to your country
There are PRODUCTION buffs, that increase your production multiplier
There are ATTACK and DEFENSE buffs, that increase your attack and defense
There are SIEGE ATTACK and SIEGE DEFENSE buffs, that increase your siege attack and siege defense
There are TOWN buffs, that increase the number of towns in a country
Now you should be prepared for this battle! You can come back here and play the tutorial battle anytime, without this dialogue!
And remember, to go back to the main menu, just press the cross in the corner!
Good luck, and have fun!
